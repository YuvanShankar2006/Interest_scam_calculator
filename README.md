# Interest_scam_calculator
This project is a Financial Calculator built using Streamlit that helps users understand the breakdown of their loans and identify potential interest-related scams by banks and loan lenders. The application provides a detailed monthly breakdown of interest payments, principal returns, and the remaining principal amount.
